# Building a Blockchain

Makers Academy practice final project. For our task we chose a technical challenge, and decided to build a blockchain from scratch.

## Approach
Team members had underdeveloped and overlapping understandings of what constitutes a blockchain. As such, in order to guide the project implementation - and in particular to reach a consensus as to what would be our MVP - the process began with a day of research.



## Tech Stack
The final blockchain is written in Ruby and development is test driven with RSpec.
The web interface combines html with erb, as well as elements of bootstrap and JQuery.
